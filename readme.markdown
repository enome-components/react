# React.js + Component.js

This is a component.js version of react.js. Since component.js uses github as a repository it's easy to host your own version. Just fork this repo and do whatever you like with it.

## Update

Change the version in `update.sh` and run `./update.sh`. Update will try and `git push` so make sure you have a remote repo.
